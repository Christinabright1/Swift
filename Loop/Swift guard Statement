In Swift, we use the guard statement to transfer program control out of scope when certain conditions are not met.

The guard statement is similar to the if statement with one major difference. The if statement runs when a certain condition is met. 
However, the guard statement runs when a certain condition is not met.

Syntax of guard Statement

The syntax of the guard statement is:

guard expression else {
  // statements
  // control statement: return, break, continue or throw.
}
